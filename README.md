<h1>Read Me</h1>
<p>This repo is the result of following the steps outlined in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Git-Visual-Approach-Successfully/dp/1098133919">"Learning Git: A Hands-On and Visual Guide to the Basics of Git"</a> which is the book I used to teach myself Git. I decided to do this as whilst I was aware that Git was a useful and ubiquitous techonology, it was never touched on in my three years at university. The project is not technical, only involving .txt files, with the focus of the book being on using Git in the command line and understanding what is happening to the files and local/remote repositories with each action. </p>
